# Delegate Your Job Search. Focus Only on Interviews.

We take care of the grind — resumes, daily job applications, email & LinkedIn replies — so you can land more interviews and offers with less stress.

---

## What We Do
- Rewrite and improve your resume & LinkedIn profile.  
- Apply to jobs every day (manual + automated).  
- Manage your inboxes and reply to recruiters on your behalf.  
- Prepare you for interviews — both behavioral and technical (with mentors if needed).  

## What We Don’t Do
- We don’t guarantee an offer in 2 months.  
- We don’t promise “perfect resumes.”  
- We don’t sell “guaranteed employment” — we build real chances.  

---

## Why It Works
- Dozens of daily applications → more reach and more interviews.  
- Unique automation + human touch → speed and accuracy.  
- You save time and stress → focus only on interviews.

## Success Stories
**Egor, Unity Developer**  
“All I had to do was attend interviews. They sent dozens of applications per day — impossible to do alone. Expensive, but pays for itself tenfold.”

**Andrey, Engineering Manager**  
“50+ interviews in 9 months. I set too high a salary bar, but the team delivered. Next time, I’ll also add English interview prep.”

**Roman, Product Designer**  
“3 months, 1,500 applications, 20 interviews, 1 offer. Could’ve had 3 more if I were less picky. Totally worth the money.”
